# Cook Me A Meal - Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitLab repository for **Cook Me A Meal**, a project developed as part of the "Systems 3" course in my second year of undergraduate studies in Computer Science. This project addresses the common problem of time constraints and the need for well-prepared meals. It aims to provide a platform for individuals who require quick and nutritious meals, as well as those who possess cooking skills and are willing to share their culinary expertise.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals, including students and working professionals, face challenges in finding healthy and convenient meal options on short notice. This often leads to unhealthy eating choices due to lack of time or cooking skills. The Cook Me A Meal project seeks to address this issue by creating a system that connects people in need of a meal with those who can provide home-cooked options. This platform is particularly beneficial for students, busy professionals, and others who struggle to find suitable dining choices.

## Proposed Solution

The Cook Me A Meal application is developed using Node.js, React.js, and a MySQL database. It serves as an information system designed to offer practical solutions for the meal-related challenges faced by various user groups. By enabling meal requests and cooking collaborations, the platform aims to save users time and money while promoting healthier eating habits.

## Scope of Work

Cook Me A Meal offers the following key features:

### 1. Account Creation

Users can register personal accounts by providing essential information. A valid email address and a secure password are required for successful account creation. Additionally, users need to specify their location during the initial setup.

### 2. Creating Meal Listings

Users can compose detailed meal listings, including information about ingredients, readiness time, available portions, pricing, and optional "vegan" tags.

### 3. Managing Posted Meals and Listings

Users can preview and delete their posted meal listings, ensuring up-to-date information about their offerings. The system allows users to align their listings with their availability and commitments.

### 4. Feed Section

A dedicated feed section displays all available meal offers, providing details about the meal's title, cook's location, and ingredients. Only meals with remaining portions and an unexpired readiness timeframe are featured in the feed.

### 5. Refining the Feed Selection

The system includes a filtering mechanism to streamline vegan meal options, enabling users to easily access meals that match their dietary preferences.

### 6. Managing Meal Requests

Users can submit meal requests specifying the desired number of portions. Cooks can approve these requests, and upon acceptance, customers gain access to the cook's contact information for further communication.
